# Upgrade Hub Bootcamp Data Analyst Final Project: Steam Game Analysis
This is my final project for the Data Analysis bootcamp I attended at Upgrade Hub. It focuses on exploring how different characteristics of Steam video games influence their success and reception by the community.

[Upgrade Hub](https://www.upgrade-hub.com/) is an educational institution dedicated to offering high-quality training programs in technology and data science.

This analysis is based on Steam data, updated as of January 2024.

## Project Content

- CSV Files: Datasets with information extracted for our analysis.
- Data Extraction: This is the script we used to obtain our data.
- Initial Analysis: A document where we perform our initial analysis of the data.
- Data Processing: Here we process all our data and transform it as needed.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A deeper analysis where we create more advanced graphs and observe stronger relationships. We also represent the Steam symbol through data mining.
- Time Series Analysis: We use the ARIMA model for our time series analysis and make future predictions about video games.
- Machine Learning: We employ a regression model (GradientBoosterRegressor) to make future price predictions for potential video games being released to the market, and use a classification model (RandomForestClassifier) to predict the future success of a video game set to be launched.
- Power BI Dashboard: A dashboard on the top 4 companies that have launched the most video games on Steam.
- Script.py: Script containing the code for our Streamlit webapp where everything is integrated. You can access it by clicking on the following [link]("https://c8fm5jg6uw4tecdvuvx4mj.streamlit.app/").
