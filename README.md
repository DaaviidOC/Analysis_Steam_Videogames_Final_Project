# UpgradeHub Bootcamp Data Analyst Final Project: Steam Game Analysis

This is my final project for the Data Analysis bootcamp I attended at Upgrade Hub. It focuses on exploring how different characteristics of Steam video games influence their success and reception by the community.

[Upgrade Hub](https://www.upgrade-hub.com/) is an educational institution dedicated to offering high-quality training programs in technology and data science.

This analysis is based on Steam data, updated as of January 2024.
